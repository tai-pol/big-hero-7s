    # Hints: 
    #
    # 1) Setting vL=MAX_SPEED and vR=-MAX_SPEED lets the robot turn
    # right on the spot. vL=MAX_SPEED and vR=0.5*MAX_SPEED lets the
    # robot drive a right curve.
    #
    # 2) If your robot "overshoots", turn slower.
    #
    # 3) Only set the wheel speeds once so that you can use the speed
    # that you calculated in your odometry calculation.
    #
    # 4) Disable all console output to simulate the robot superfast
    # and test the robustness of your approach.

    # TODO: Insert Line Following Code Here  
    
    # TODO: Call update_odometry Here
    
    # Hints:
    #
    # 1) Divide vL/vR by MAX_SPEED to normalize, then multiply with
    # the robot's maximum speed in meters per second. 
    #
    # 2) SIM_TIMESTEP tells you the elapsed time per step. You need
    # to divide by 1000.0 to convert it to seconds
    #
    # 3) Do simple sanity checks. In the beginning, only one value
    # changes. Once you do a right turn, this value should be constant.
    #
    # 4) Focus on getting things generally right first, then worry
    # about calculating odometry in the world coordinate system of the
    # Webots simulator first (x points down, y points right)

    
    # TODO: Insert Loop Closure Code Here
    
    # Hints:
    #
    # 1) Set a flag whenever you encounter the line
    #
    # 2) Use the pose when you encounter the line last 
    # for best results
